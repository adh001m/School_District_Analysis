# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project
  From given data, create different dataframes seperating school math and reading scores by size of school and district type, Furthermore, create a district summary for each district.
  
### Purpose
  To familairize oneself with panda dataframes, the .loc function, and numpy. Throught this project, one should begin to distinguish complex factors (zuch as class size or district type in this case) affecting data sets.
 
### Analysis
Beginning with charter schools vs regular district schools, students at charter schools tend to do much better in math and english than students in regular district schools. Moving on to class size, students in smaller class sizes also tend to do better than students in large class sizes. A correlation we could make between these two is that charter schools already tend to have smaller classes and therefore have higher test scores. From this data, we can conclude that smaller class sizes equate to higher test scores.
